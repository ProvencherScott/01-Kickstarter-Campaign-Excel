# Kickstarter Campaign Data Analysis

After modifying the data provided from Kickstarter, I was able to build a workbook with several graphs on Excel and perform my own analysis. I modified and organized the data of 4,000 Kickstarter projects using conditional formatting, pivot tables and various formulas. There are a total of three pivot tables and four graphs on 'Kickstarter Campaign Data Analysis'. There are two files in the folder 'Analysis Report' which answer these questions:

# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?


# Bonus Statistical Analysis

Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

* Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
